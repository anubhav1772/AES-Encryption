### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
AES or Advanced Encryption Standards (also known as Rijndael) is one of the most widely used methods for encrypting and decrypting sensitive information in 2017.
This encryption method uses what is known as a block cipher algorithm to ensure that data can be stored securely.

The features of AES are as follows âˆ’
* Symmetric key symmetric block cipher
* 128-bit data, 128/192/256-bit keys
* Stronger and faster than Triple-DES
* Provide full specification and design details
* Software implementable in C and Java
